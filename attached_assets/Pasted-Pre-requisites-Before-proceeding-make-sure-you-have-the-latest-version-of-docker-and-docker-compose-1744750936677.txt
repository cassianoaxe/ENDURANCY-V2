Pre-requisites
Before proceeding, make sure you have the latest version of docker and docker compose installed.

As of now at the time of writing this doc, we recommend a version equal to or higher than the following.


$ docker --version
Docker version 26.1.3, build b72abbb
$ docker compose version
Docker Compose version v2.27.0
Why Docker?
Why Docker Compose?
Get docker image
Follow the instructions below:

WAHA Core
‚ûï WAHA Plus
WAHA (ARM)
Run the command below:


docker pull devlikeapro/waha
Install
Install Docker on your VM

# example in ubuntu
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
apt install docker-compose-plugin
Download the required files

# Download the env file template
wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlikeapro/waha/refs/heads/core/.env.example
# Download the Docker compose template
wget -O docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlikeapro/waha/refs/heads/core/docker-compose.yaml
Tweak the .env and docker-compose.yaml according to your preferences. Refer to the available environment variables in ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration.
Some important values you MUST change before running it:

API Key for secure API access. Read more üîí Security
WHATSAPP_API_KEY=123
Username, password for üìä Dashboard:
WAHA_DASHBOARD_USERNAME=waha
WAHA_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=waha
Username, password for üìö Swagger:
WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_USERNAME=admin
WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_PASSWORD=admin

# update .env file with your values
nano .env
# update docker-compose.yaml - like image
# Remove "mongodb" and "minio" services if you don't need them
# Leave "waha" service as it is
nano docker-compose.yaml
Get the service up and running.

docker compose up -d
Your WAHA installation is complete. Please note that the containers are not exposed to the internet, and they only bind to the localhost. Setup something like Nginx or any other proxy server to proxy the requests to the container.

Now, open http://localhost:3000/dashboard and login with the credentials you‚Äôve set (waha/waha by default).

Also, you could temporarily drop the 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 for waha to 3000:3000 in the compose file to access your instance at http://<your-external-ip>:3000. It‚Äôs recommended to revert this change back and use Nginx or some proxy server in the front.

Additional Steps
Configure Nginx and Let‚Äôs Encrypt
üëâ Replace <YOURDOMAIN.COM> with your domain name in the following steps (use lowercase).

Configure Nginx to serve as a frontend proxy.

sudo apt-get install nginx
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

nano <YOURDOMAIN.COM>.conf
Use the following Nginx config and replace the <YOURDOMAIN.COM> in server_name.

server {
  server_name <YOURDOMAIN.COM>;

  # Point upstream to WAHA Server
  set $upstream 127.0.0.1:3000;

  location /.well-known {
    alias /var/www/ssl-proof/waha/.well-known;
  }

  location / {
    proxy_pass_header Authorization;
    proxy_pass http://$upstream;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on; # Optional

    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_buffering off;

    client_max_body_size 0;
    proxy_read_timeout 36000s;
    proxy_redirect off;
  }
  listen 80;
}
Verify and reload your Nginx config by running the following command.

nginx -t
systemctl reload nginx
Run Let‚Äôs Encrypt to configure SSL certificate. (replace <YOURDOMAIN.COM>!)

apt install certbot
apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx
mkdir -p /var/www/ssl-proof/waha/.well-known

certbot --webroot -w /var/www/ssl-proof/waha/ -d <YOURDOMAIN.COM> -i nginx
Your WAHA installation should be accessible from the https://yourdomain.com now.
Change WAHA_BASE_URL=https://<YOURDOMAIN.COM> in the .env file and restart the WAHA service

# Change the WAHA_BASE_URL in .env
nano .env
# Restart the WAHA service
docker compose up -d
docker compose restart
Update
When there‚Äôs a new version of WAHA, you can update it with a single commands:

‚ûï WAHA Plus image:


# Login if you're using WAHA Plus
docker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY}
docker compose pull
docker logout

docker compose up -d
üëâ If you specified exact version in docker-compose.yml, like


image: devlikeapro/waha-plus:latest-2024.7.8
remember to change it to latest-{YEAR}.{MONTH}.{BUILD} to get the latest version.

WAHA Core image:


docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
Get logs, restart, stop

# Stop all containers
docker compose down
# Start all containers, apply new configuration
docker compose up -d
# Restart all containers
docker compose restart
# Show logs in real time
docker compose logs -f
# Show logs - since interval
docker compose logs --since 1h
